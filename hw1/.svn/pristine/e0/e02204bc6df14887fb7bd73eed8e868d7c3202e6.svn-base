In my opinion, this homework is very helpful for us to understand the new knowledge that we just learnt from the lecture 1, and it urges us to read the materials carefully, which is very useful for us to remember the theory and knowledge well. But I have to say that the paper that we have to read in this section is a little bit long, which cost me over 2 hours to understand it well, but this is also good for developing my English reading skill.
