This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better. I got more familiar to the serialization, including transform the data into Writable and WritableComparable. And learn more about the Sequencefile and compression, including create and read the sequencefile and compress and decompress files. And also the creating an Iverted Index.
