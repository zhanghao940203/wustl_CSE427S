This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better. I got more familiar to use the job configruation to adjust parmater locally with commend line and running the programs locally with commendline by applying toolrunner and with eclipse. And I also got more familiar to the design of mapreducer and its working theory.
